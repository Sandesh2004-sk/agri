# 🌿 AGRICURE — Grape Plant Disease Recognition System

AGRICURE is a deep learning–based plant disease recognition system that detects grape leaf diseases from images.  
The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning models to classify plant leaf conditions and assist in early disease detection.

This system helps farmers, researchers, and students identify grape plant diseases quickly using image-based prediction.
